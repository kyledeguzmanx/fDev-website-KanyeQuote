# KANYE WEST QUOTE GENERATOR
## INTRODUCTION
This is a quote generator to showcase random things Kanye West has said. Many developers have a random quote generator in their portfolio, and this is my take. This project had a few goals: experiment with APIs and the JS Fetch API, practice CSS Flexbox, and implement a video background. This project was successful in achieving those technical goals; however, stylistically the site does not represent my expectations. In a future project, I am going to make a completely new and fresh attempt.
